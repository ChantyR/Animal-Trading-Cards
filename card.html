			<p class="italics tinysize">As part of a promotion for the Japanese anime "Kemono Friends" (Animal Friends), anthropomorphized standees of various animals were placed in exhibits in Japanese zoos. Peculiarly, a particular Humboldt penguin, named Grape-kun, began exhibiting strange behavior towards the standee---which was recognized as mating dances Humboldt penguins perform for a partner, and when the standee was removed as the advertising campaign had finished, Grape-kun was visibly upset. The standee was put back in place, and Grape-kun went down in history as the penguin who loved an anime wife.</p>

			<p class="tinysize">Medium-sized for penguins, Humboldt penguins grow to just over 2 feet tall and weigh roughly 10 lbs. They are most easily identified by a black "breast" band and their beak, which is light-pink at the base. They are otherwise mostly blackish-gray on the upper part of their body, and mostly white on the lower part of their body, with a white stripe running on the head from around the eyes around the ears and then connects around the chin.</p>

<!--I retrieved the picture from https://www.express.co.uk/news/nature/808265/Penguin-falls-in-love-cardboard-girl-staring-Tobu-zoo-hululu-anime while I got the information regarding Humboldt penguins both from the website https://www.biologicaldiversity.org/species/birds/penguins/Humboldt_penguin.html and the wikipedia page https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Humboldt_penguin . The fun fact specifics itself I recalled from memory, because I was involved and super enthusiastic about Grape-kun back when he was popular and it was a big meme on the web. Naturally, all of the coding itself is my own work; I just had to retrieve the picture and scientific information elsewhere.-->
